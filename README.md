# CH32V003-tiny-in-line-dev-board
A tiny CH32V003 32bit RISC-V prototype development board in an unusual form factor - 8 pins single in-line.
A CH32V003J4M6 SOP-8 IC is used. It has 6 IO pins one of which is used for flashing the ROM. It has 16kB of flash (large for an SOP-8 MCU) and 2kB of RAM and runs at 24MHz max with no crystal. It costs only Â£0.13 (+local tax) (20 off) on Aliexpress.

I did the project as an exercise in minimalism and aesthetics - and yes, the soldering could be neater.


## Notable design features
* Size 20x17x7mm
* LED/12k resistor to ground on PC4 (pin 7) and push button switch to ground on PA2 (pin3).
* 5V or 3.3V power.

**Construction**

Built on a 1.27mm pitch prototyping PCB. using SMD components, apart from the header. An 8x1 turned-pin male header carries all the IC pins. There's no separate flashing header. Just plug it into a standard 0.1in pitch breadboard and connect pins 2, 4 and 8 to a WCH-LinkE (or other) flasher.

The push switch is 4.5x3mm. I tried a 2x3mm switch but it was too tricky to press.

## Programming
I used both Arduino and the CH32V003fun environment in PlatformIO (in Visual Studio). 

**Arduino**
This was straighforward using the WCH official CH32V Boards Manager (https://github.com/openwch/board_manager_files/raw/main/package_ch32v_index.json ). However the Arduino Blink sketch uses a crazy 10368 bytes, leaving only ~6KB unused.

**PlatformIO / CH32V003fun**
I found this much more difficult to get working. I hadn't used PlatformIO for a while, and then only with imported Arduino sketches. 
https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun promised small code size. Blink is only 512B.
I could not get code to compile until I realised that I needed to set the top level ch32v003fun as the project folder then edit the platformio.ini file there to specify which example to build. To build one of the examples this involves deleting all the [env:xxxx] sections apart for the one I wanted eg blink:
_[env:blink]
extends = fun_base_003
build_src_filter = ${fun_base.build_src_filter} +<examples/blink>_

Also to build for the SOP-8 MCU instead of the TSSOP-20 default:
_[fun_base_003]
extends = fun_base
; or genericCH32V003A4M6 or whatever, see platform link
board = genericch32v003j4m6_

Even though the code compiled there was still an error shown under PROBLEMS (_cannot open source file "funconfig.h"_) but that turned out to be a supurious Intellisense thing. The latest ch32v003fun download fixes this.
